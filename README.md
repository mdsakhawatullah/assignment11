About MobileServe.
Why We Exist.
We believe that when volunteers share their experiences, the desire to make a difference spreads to those around them. So MobileServe exists to help volunteers and organizations share stories that are authentic and accessible, and to connect people with organizations, causes, and each other, so that single acts of service can inspire an entire culture of doing more good.

How it All Began (Hint: We were just like you).
The idea for MobileServe was born on a volunteer service trip in 2011. Ben Reno-Weber, then CEO of the Kentucky YMCA Youth Center, and Christopher Head, one of the volunteers on the trip, were sharing their frustrations with the difficulty of communicating the impact of student volunteers. Ben wanted a way to celebrate all the amazing things volunteers from his organization were doing (and assigning a dollar figure to that wouldn’t hurt either). Chris wanted a way to share his lifelong love of service work and to get more of his friends to participate. Both wanted something mobile, easy to use, and that didn’t look like it was built in the 90s. When they couldn’t find a solution, they decided to build one.
